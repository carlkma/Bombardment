## Background
In the current fast-paced developing society, people often feel stressed due to the pressure from large amounts of workload. This might lead to a number of psychological problems such as negative stress. These mental problems often result in a reduction in working efficiencies. As a result, it is important to combine entertainment, such as gaming, with workload to maximize efficiency. Therefore, our group decided to create a game to prevent the mental problems that might result from stress. In addition, due to the development of communication technologies, people are spending less time together. Instead, most people only interact with each other through social media. In an effort to try to bring people together in person, our group decided to create a multi-player game running on one computer, so that the players can meet each other in person while playing this game.

After some discussion within our group and with a surveyed population, our group decided to program the game “Bombardment”, a multi-player two-dimensional player-versus-player game inspired by the popular game “Bomb It!”. Most of the students to whom we talked expressed their desire for the joy of victory over fellow students. Therefore, we decided to make our game player-versus-player rather than cooperative. However, to prevent the creation of tension between friends, we decided to not set any awards for the victories achieved in this game. For example, the top score ranking system is a function discussed in our group, but later discarded to avoid the loss of valuable friendship between the players, and solely the joy of victory can be enjoyed by the winner while the loser won’t feel too discouraged. Also, the maneuverings of the players are specially designed so that the keys on the left side of the board control the player on the right, and vice versa. The crossing-over created by this arrangement creates an even stronger bond between the players. In addition, the simple rules of this game make it easy for people to play it in spare time while not becoming addicted to it. These designs adhere to the intended purpose of our game of creating friendly bonds between people through competition and the emphasis of recreational activities in the spare time between the intense work.

## Game Instructions
The rules of the game are as follows: there are two players in the maze made up of two types of blocks. The blue blocks can be destroyed by bombs, while the black blocks cannot and are permanent. The players can move around in the empty white grids, and deploy bombs at the grids that they are in. The bombs will explode 2 seconds after they are deployed, their range by default being one grid each upwards, leftwards, downwards, and rightwards. For each direction, if the fire storm reaches a barrier, it will stop at that barrier. The characters can also pick up range expansion tools (represented by the lightning bolt symbol) and mines (represented with an allusion to the potato mines in the popular game Plants versus Zombies). The former expands the range of the player’s bomb by 1 grid unit in every direction, while the latter makes the next bomb that the player deploys a mine with a range of 3 grids. This means it will remain invisible as a normal white empty grid until any of the players step on it, which activates the mine immediately.

## Brief history
Bombardment was initiated in 2019 as part of the author's Grade 10 Computer Science course. It was developed in collaboration with Kevin Cheng. As of 2020, the software is open sourced but is no longer maintained.
